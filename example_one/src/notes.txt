Priority is to get the MetaMask (travis extension) working with the DApp.

Other work can be as follows

The following is an example of how we would get the block height from a local synced node (obtained by following the installation script in the README at this location https://github.com/CyberMiles/travis )

Firstly we would need to add code to the index.js file so that we could access the CMT node using web3cmt
var Web3 = require("web3-cmt")
var web3 = new Web3(new Web3.providers.HttpProvider("http://localhost:8545"))

We would then execute the following syntax
web3.eth.getBlock(function(error, result){ if(!error) console.log(JSON.stringify(result)); else	console.log(error); })

Lastly, as an item on the wish list is to get Scatter :-)
